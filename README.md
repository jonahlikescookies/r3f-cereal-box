# React Three Fiber Cereal Box Project

This project uses bun so you have to install that, follow instructions at https://bun.sh/docs/installation
If for some reason you want to use this as a reference (don't), you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonahlikescookies/r3f-cereal-box.git r3f-cereal-box
cd r3f-cereal-box
bun install
bun run dev
```
